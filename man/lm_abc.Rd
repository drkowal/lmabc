\title{Fitting Linear Models with Abundance-Based Constraints}
\usage{
lm_abc(formula, data, ..., cprobs = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class \code{"\link[stats]{formula}"} (or one that
    can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the
    model to be fitted.  The details of model specification are given
    under \sQuote{Details}.}

\item{data}{a data frame (or object coercible by \link{as.data.frame} to a data frame) containing the variables in the model.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to the low level
    regression fitting functions (see below).}

\item{cprobs}{a named list with an entry for each named categorical variable in the model, specifying the probabilities of each category.}
}
\description{
\code{lm_abc} is used to fit linear models using abundance-based constraints.
}
\section{Details}{
An \link{lmabc} model is specified identically to the corresponding \link{lm} model. At this time, \link{lmabc} only supports a single response variable, and the data must be passed into the \link{data} parameter.
}

\section{Differences from \link{lm}}{
Standard linear regression models chose one level for each categorical factor and make it a "baseline," which is necessary to not over-parameterize the model. The coefficients on the continuous \eqn{X} variables are specifically for the baseline category and do not represent a global effect. Similarly, the coefficients on the non-baseline levels are in comparison to the baseline level.

This framework can lead to biases in interpretation. Suppose a researcher includes \link{age} and \link{race} as explanatory variables. \link{lm} will report the coefficient for \link{age}, which is really the baseline-specific coefficient for \link{age}; the baseline is often chosen to be the most prevalent category, often non-Hispanic White (NHW). Thus, the coefficient for NHW is implicitly represented as the global effect. The coefficient for any other race dummy is the expected change in the \eqn{Y} variable compared to the baselineâ€”again, not the true effect of identifying as that race.

\link{lmabc} introduces abundance-based constraints (ABCs). Each "baseline" coefficient now represents the group-averaged coefficient with weights given by the sample proportions or by \link{cprobs}. That is, the coefficient on \link{age} is the weighted average of each race-specific effect.
}

\section{Value}{
\link{lmabc} returns an object of class "lmabc." Many generics commonly used for \link{lm} objects have been implemented for \link{lmabc}: \link{summary}, \link{coefficients}, \link{plot}, \link{predict}, and more. See the DESCRIPTION file for all implemented S3 methods.
