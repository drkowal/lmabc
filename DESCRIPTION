Description: lmabc provides estimation and inference for 
		linear regression with categorical covariates (race, sex, etc.). 
		Common strategies, including the defaults in lm, select
		a "reference" group (e.g,. White, Male, etc.) and present
		all results relative to this group. Crucially, this
		introduces biases and inequities into both the presentation
		of results and in some cases, the statistical estimation
		itself. lmabc uses abundance-based constraints (ABCs) that 
		(1) fully eliminate these biases, (2) provide appealing statistical
		properties related to estimation invariance and improved statistical
		power, and (3) produce more interpretable model output. lmabc reproduces 
		the core functionality of lm and includes functions for both generalized 
		(logistic, Poisson, etc.) and penalized (lasso, ridge, etc.) linear models. 
		Details are provided in Kowal (2024) <doi:10.1101/2024.01.04.23300033>.
