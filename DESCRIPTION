Description: lmabc introduces an implementation of linear regression with abundance-based constraints, which seeks to increase equity and interpretability in statistical analyses. Traditional linear regression models with categorical predictors choose a "baseline" category, generally the most prevalent one, which tends to be non-Hispanic White for race. This creates inequities in the presentation and interpretation of such models. lmabc uses an averaging approach to change the baseline from a single arbitrarily-chosen level to the global average.
