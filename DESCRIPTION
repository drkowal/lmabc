Description: lmabc provides estimation and inference for linear regression
    with categorical covariates (race, sex, etc.).  Common strategies,
    including the defaults in lm, select a "reference" group (e.g,. White,
    Male, etc.) and present all results relative to this group. However,
    this approach suffers from alarming biases, statistical
    inefficiencies, and limited interpretability. lmabc uses
    abundance-based constraints (ABCs) that (1) fully eliminate these
    biases, (2) provide appealing statistical properties related to
    estimation invariance and improved statistical power, and (3) produce
    more interpretable model output. lmabc reproduces the core
    functionality of lm and includes functions for generalized (logistic,
    Poisson, etc.) and penalized (lasso, ridge, etc.) linear models.
